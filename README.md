Transcript Builder is a Python desktop application built using Tkinter and SQLite for managing student academic records.
It allows users to add students and their subjects semester-wise, view detailed transcripts, and calculate GPA and CGPA 
automatically. Additionally, the application supports importing bulk data directly from Excel files, making it easy to 
integrate existing records into the system.
The UI is user-friendly and provides functionality like dropdown-based filtering, dynamic GPA computation, and a structured
view of subject-wise performance.
